# ESM Modules

Playing around with ES modules just cause.

I haven't implemented / intregated BabelJS into this repo which is why I'm using the `--experimental-modules` flag and pointing at an `.mjs` file - eg. `index.mjs`

The Babel website has a fab [Using Babel](https://babeljs.io/setup) page if you want to know what to do with the various tools.
